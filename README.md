# Automatic Dianping WebCrawler

It is a python based WebCrawler for the Dianping website that can be used to extract publicly viewable 
information of different cuisine category restaurants and user review information. This project was used for my thesis to integrate and build a recommendation system application.



## Usage

```bash
# to extract shop names
python start_shop.py
# to extract shop reviews
python start_reviews.py
```
